					<h2>1. APTITUDE</h2>
					<p>An aptitude test is a way for employers to assess a candidate’s abilities through a variety of different testing
						 formats. Aptitude tests will test your ability to perform tasks and react to situations at work. This includes
						  problem-solving, prioritisation and numerical skills, amongst other things. The psychometric tests are 
						  multiple-choice and there is only ever one correct answer, your score is then marked and your level is 
						  compared against other candidates who have taken the same test as you. There are free tests online that you 
						  can take to gauge what sort of questions to expect when taking an aptitude test</p><br>

					<h2> Why and how do you take an aptitude test?</h2>
					<p> Aptitude tests are a great way for a hiring manager to gauge a candidate’s suitability to a role. They are a tool used to
						 see how candidates might deal with the challenges of the role they are interviewing for.</p>
						 <br>
					<h2>Types of aptitude tests</h2>
					<p><strong>Diagrammatic Reasoning – </strong>Tests your ability of logical reasoning, using diagrams and flowcharts.<br>
						<strong>Numerical Reasoning –</strong> Tests your mathematical ability through percentages, averages and the like.<br>
						<strong>Verbal Reasoning –</strong> Assesses you on your ability to assess verbal logic.<br>
						<strong>Inductive Reasoning –</strong> Tests your ability to see patterns and analyse data,in a pressurised environment.<br>
						<strong>Situational Judgement –</strong> Tests your problem-solving ability. <br>
						<strong>Logical Reasoning –</strong> Tests your ability to recognise patterns, sequences or relationships between shapes and imagery.<br>
						<strong>Abstract Reasoning –</strong> These are similar to IQ tests and assess general knowledge, and ability to utilise your knowledge in new situations.</p><br>


					<h2>2. GROUP DISCUSSION</h2>
					<p>Group discussion is when a group of people comes together to discuss a certain topic.Many Recruiters use group discussion (GD)
						 to test a candidate’s communication skills, leadership skills, test topic knowledge, etc. There are also two other types of 
						 GD that test the lateral thinking of a candidate. It is a short case study & Group exercise. Often the group discussion 
						 rounds are considered tough, but it is not tough if you follow certain steps.</p>
					<p><strong>*Having Rich Content with Good knowledge<br>*Being a leader<br>*Try to be relevant to the topic.<br>*Be a Good listener.<br>*Communication skills and Body language is very important. </strong></p><br>


					<h2>3. Technical Round</h2>
					<p> The purpose of technical interview questions is to assess if your level of technical knowledge is on par with what is 
						required for the position you are interviewing for.<br>The interviewer will ask you to specify the technical education and training you have undergone and will attempt to assess how well-suited you are for the available position with their company.
						Your response should include your formal educational qualifications and any additional courses you have done and certifications.</p>

					<h2>4. HR round</h2>
					<p> The HR round is an interview that’s typically conducted by a human resources generalist at the beginning of the hiring process. In this initial screen, HR interviewers want to find out general information about 
						your previous roles, core qualifications, key strengths and weaknesses, and salary expectations.<br>During an HR round, you can expect high-level, general questions about you, your past work experience, and your motive for looking for a new position. Expect to receive 
						questions that allude to your aptitudes and competencies, but that don't go too in depth about role-specific responsibilities.</p>
