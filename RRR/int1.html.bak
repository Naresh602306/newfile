					<h1>INTERVIEW PROCESS</h1><br>

					<h2>1. What Is the Interview Process?</h2>
					<p>The interview process is a multi-stage process for hiring new employees. The interview process typically
						 includes the following steps: writing a job description, posting a job, scheduling interviews, conducting 
						 preliminary interviews, conducting in-person interviews, following up with candidates and making a hire.</p>
						 <br>
					<h2>2. Interview Process Steps & How to Improve Them</h2>
					<p> There is much debate by industry professionals on the best ways to improve the interview process. And by improve,
						we mean attract and make better hires. One theory is that harder job interviews actually lead to better job matches-
						but is this true? It turns out, yes. Candidates who go through a rigorous interview process often find that the company
					  places a high value on finding employees who are a good match for both the position and the company culture.<br>
					  Want to improve your company's interview process? Here are some steps to consider when structuring your interview process:<br>
					 <strong>->The Phone Screener</strong><br>
					  Phone interviews are an easy way to screen job seekers. In just a few quick questions, phone screeners allow you to vet a 
					  candidate and make sure they are a strong match skill-wise before you decide to invest further time in them. At this stage,
					  you'll want to focus on high-level questions to make sure they meet the requirements of the role.<br>
					<strong>->The Skill Test</strong><br>Behavioral questions allow you to find the best fit for each role, and help you hire employees who 
					can drive innovation, productivity, customer satisfaction and profits. Determine test objectives, e.g. personality, values, skills,
					etc. and decide how candidates will be moved forward or eliminated based on the results.<br>  
				     <strong>->The In-Person Interview</strong><br> At this stage in the interview process, you already know that the candidate is generally 
					 well-qualified for the role, so it's time to dig further into culture fit and work style. See if you can identify what motivates a 
					 candidate, what drew them to your company and how they work on a team, amongst other questions.<br>
					<strong>->The Group Panel</strong><br> By meeting with a variety of people, candidates get a comprehensive picture of the culture and the job 
					itself, and team members get a strong sense of the contribution the job seeker will make as an employee. Make sure you prepare 
					interviewers with the job description and the candidate's resume. Also, don't forget to identify a panel leader, and assign roles 
					to each interviewer based on job function and/or expertise.<br></p>
					<h2>3. Great Interview Questions to Ask Candidates</h2>
					<p> Struggling to come up with interview questions to ask your candidates? These questions will help you find top talent fast:<br>
					    *What attracts you most to this position and company?<br>
							*What was the best thing about your last job?<br>
							*Tell me about a time you had a difficult working relationship with a colleague. What was the challenge, how did you address the situation and what did you learn from the experience?<br>
							*What is a development area, a deficit, or a gap that you've had to overcome or improve in your career? How was that identified, and what did you do to improve?<br>
							*What are two of the most satisfying accomplishments in your career? Tell me about each of them.<br>
							*Do you have any questions for me?</p>
